## Introduction

This organization was born out of some frustrations regarding a lack of compatibility of devcontainer features for RPM-based Linux distributions. We wanted to start with some base images first, allowing people to pull in RedHat's Universal Base Images for versions 7, 8, and 9. RHEL7 is not considered a supported OS for the purposes of Codespaces, however, so use that at your own risk.
